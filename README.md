 i. 


   who among us has not killed, i mean think of it the pause before the crawling the flying the end-it-all when we have a choice, really have a choice between killing, going back, and yet raise the lifted weight , i'm staring at her mouth now the light is a hovering glow atop spiraling pineboard painted black and splintering thick next to the mattress, her wings are burnt rouge digging a deep hole, two torn parachutes fraying and I'm staring at her mouth and thinking how i could squash it between my thumb and first knuckle if i wanted to , if i really wanted and what's worse is i don't know how to handle that question, the answer the pause between the flapping of the wings, the melody to her movements, her clawed-shut wingedness , and people are behind bars for this, and when she looks like that , her chin pointing ever-towards that dotted light glowing dim it's hard for me to imagine her going on living , if she moves i think i'll do it , it seems like surely her last moments , her waiting for me there memorializing the last bright light of her life, the moment like morning when nothing has yet been ruined , nothing has gone stale, the moment triumphant still flooded with hopeful prayer, kissing and the look of someone on the precipice of something, i don't just mean something, i mean the very key to their existence, a forgotten answer unbroken, a dreamscaped shadow looking back and im thankful for this , her showing me exactly what i've been missing in living, without this moment , her slowing to silence frozen in windless room, her sorry mouth stuffed with sky, and next to her the crosshatched lace runner J's grandmother brought here at least three decembers ago , the way that laughter echoed through the spliced-open pine beams earlier that evening , the way we could not think of the documentary's title , turning it in our minds for hours, unable to confirm without phone signal what it was for the record or when we'd last truly tasted mysterious sweet namelessness like this, unsure if it was a poltergeist or really only the tilted ceiling fan knocking , until at last we stumbled upon it in simple syntax and after all that it was nothing at all , nothing beyond two words <i>The Scheme </i> how simple it all was , to kill or to not kill was not even a question on our minds she was probably flying somewhere in small circles , flying somehow ovalesque or sitting still, oblivious

and i find her there in the morning , propped between soapstone and knotted pine wall smoothed and smoothed again , her mouth closed now and legs bowed i see her and think now she is tempting fate, her gaze cast upward again towards that two way hanging street that is the mirror , her eyes not giving way to anything,
her eyes two frozen volcanic lakes, wings stained cathedrals, mouth like a made bed, blankets turning, a widening vacuum, patting down and down the walls,
and i see her there thinking buzzing nothing , cast upwards towards the bare yellow bulb embedded into pine , what could she be thinking i think i know nothing about a species' thought unless it is my own and even then i have no way to bridge our existence , cannot imagine the first thought upon waking the memories that clog , can only see a version of myself replicated and replicated , unable to shake or cut the corded light , a cracked seam so close I can almost touch her but we are not touching , my meekness inside of her meekness, and only this instant, this exact flash.




iii.
  
and i see her there , face down in the white porcelain bowl, her legs splayed out beneath her on the sink's curvature like milk-coated tendrils, legs like a fresh fawn's, unable but not unwanting to run, just the pads of them bracing against the stone cool white , thinking not thinking of the presence behind her towering breathing not thinking of her wings, burnt black, her shoulder blades taut like rubber overlaid with silk, mouth like a boomerang , just staying still. nearby an eyelash like a spiraled tern,  floating feather upon the bowl not yet falling but clinging to its side along her , urging her towards,  away from the faucet's stream , its spouting into bubbling whirlpool pooling beneath chrome on chrome, her patient wading, the sagging droplets that cling to the slick sides of the porcelain's bowl , her silence saying nothing, not thinking or naming all of the names of those who look like her , not even a curiosity, only this very flash, this instant , this indeterminate sound of rushing water that she knows as death, that i know as life , a calm washing over me inviting its lifesource, rushing , pulsing yes maybe threatening after all this waiting and wondering giving her a voice to speak. 


she does not think through it's gurgling, naming the  droplets or mulling over osmosis functions , the molecular make up of water or what is it h20 the suffocating weight of names does not crush her overlaid silken wings or it would , she'd buckle under the weight of it, all the knowing all  the falling downwards through thousands of pounds of pine and porcelain and wet cloth and plumbing and electrical wire , not even knowing the names for it she's perched , hovers almost above the surface not knowing how close to drowning falling crushed by the weight of it all , just my waiting.



iv.

and i see her there now , inside of me like a memory, a burning lake, and i want to know what'd be like to touch her likeness, reach out softly, but i can't , incantory being , legs like an infant ,(her sorry mouth stuffed with sky), there's no asking where she's going , even this is a placeholder



v.

and i see her there in the driveway, her is any, a slate morning turned blank, the whole sky in her mouth, her mouth is any, i see her stone-stopped, no reflection, unsophisticated, unwanting still after the moon"s turning , gone, blank , here I imagine to smell hyacinths, think nothing , unlike me who is always thinking attempting to name unnameable , the oaks along the hunting house, the endless well, she's unnamed too but i insist on naming but for now settle on her, her is anyone, though inevitably ill make her someone, a thought without blinking, an eyeful of sorries, the whole year in her wings, wider than three hundred spaceships staring back, although i'm grateful i was born in concentration, yesterday i_______



vi.

laughing backwards, i see her there unwittingly herself I'm beginning to find the pattern of us, between the cracked lines there are , again, unfolding windows of wisdom to the core of it all im tired of trying to put a dazzling bluegreen bow on it, she seems to be saying to me , her eyes half falling open , only a memory, my sister, her sister, calling me asking to go to a meeting, I tell her the time difference makes it difficult but there is always an evening meeting to attend, a yearning for better, for better or worse she can meet me there , night is always closing in on us even faster than we can conceive of, a conception unfolding among us, the story of a mogwai, she tells me, i'm sorry , it all went by so fast, a blurred blacked coin of an evening , I tell her <I>you shone brightly</I> , and meant it.


vii. 

and i see her there in the upward curling light, chains hanging from her mouth, her stillness upending some version of immersive tension in the blinding break of the fold, a version of her miniature and waiting below, wading in the fold, harboring a message, spit and undertow and wild light blocking blackness, just waiting for her, and I not even a thought in her mind, but i didn't come here for this, to memorize her stuffed mouth, to hush the mouth that eats her undying below, i only came to pour the water boiling, to stop the whistling and start the steeping and now i'm caught again between her and the kettle, caught in the folds not thinking breathing, listening to air.


viii.

and i see her there , perched on an electrical box, or maybe it was a water meter, in the residential part of town, a brownstone painted blue, her legs tucked into her heart, her wings cracked pearls, weighing no more than an idea, are her wings cracked or etched, i ask myself and then the whole thing slides out from under me, this concept i hold onto , the naming the rush the hush of the mouth that feeds on itself


ix.
there, i see her clinging to the plane's slate wing, flight 955(boeing) clinging to all 655 miles per hour, which is traveling the exact speed at which a plane travels, see her there , her own wings as barren and wide as the cloudless sky, a parachute to nowhere, she considers the plunge, decides against it i think, and what are those jagged antennas sticking out from the wing's frigid tusks, parallel jutting back, like two streets you confuse the names of, the way they run parallel and don't represent much change at all, two names for the same momentumed path, leading us to sameness, so why name them at all, other than Here, why not just say Here, There and There and Here, unworthy of memory's churning, below her she sees each cloud as an option, a ghost's prayer answered, a road home, and earlier the unassigned seat the assigned bag the broken printer the frozen computer screen, each pivot an option, i think i see her now considering the vastness and again, no, better not, best to brace against the wind's cutting, windquick like a samurai - momentum all tightrope and spiked nunchucks -, she thinks , <i>i live here now but why,</i> never asking to be and <i>i'm so thirsty</i> she thinks, (they should offer complimentary beverages) splicing through the white mist its molecules parading as barriers, why Here, the billowing the swelling the sheer force of it, this milling, this instant


x.

and i see her there, drunk on light, iridescent teetering on the table's edge, hanging from the weight of us, not asking but not daring go back, go back why don't you she thinks but still can't speak and it's just me again, putting words into her sorry mouth, wishing i was a mother, wishing my own mother were present when I was small, wishing there were a difference between those two wishes, knowing they're the same, the same knowing that she feels, hanging from the corner's edge unwilling to let go unable to step back, release herself from this twisted imbalanced act, but how does one? and don't we?


xi.

and i see her there, lying 
on the kitchen's sill, throat 
of honeysuckle, ripe nectar,
golden evening forgotten; she came
quickly to the window, 
that's all, wanted to greet morning 
as we so often do, but now 
her crushed neck, its lulling 
slope towards a soft belly, 
her wide eyes waiting,
tongue an airbag(snare/flare)
water flows between us

***

xii.

and i see her there, drunk on light again, swirling incandescent diving towards the brass mirror upholding its luminary weight unafraid, as the washer's whirring drowns out coyotesong or blurs it, maybe, in an uncertain way that makes me whisper thank you, for its mystery, its unending want, how it makes me want nightweight, moments when you can't be sure if it's sound or touch you're hearing, like tumbling water and mate-cry, all good morning and he backed out of the drive last night but drove into the house, and how many times can we relive this and saying sorry doesn't mean that someone will hear it -- may god bless your tears, may she drink them


xiii.

and i see her there and she's small still and folding herself, thorax ghost-webbed morphing into a fine dust and coating the granite beneath her, I see she has not one but two pair of wings, one to have one to hold but now, becoming nothing, becoming not anything that she wanted, except maybe the times when the light pierces through the broken bathroom window, it's splintering edge, and glints in just so, makes it look like she's flying in that instant, her perfect instant, both forewings and hindwings are lifted, their thousands of scales like shingles on thousands of roofs all glimmering into one broken house on a sideways street or byway between what once was and what definitely cannot be and there i could see that myself was never the point it was us in this moment, a reminder of beyond, the beyond-meaning we are always missing, what there is only and front-center but never truly seeing how anything is, it's always slipping, never holding our attention long enough this silent becoming, and yet somehow then she was flying i swear she was flying



***
xiv.

and i see her there her sorry mouth stuffed with with light her legs flailing failing to ascend the attic into heaven. don't tell me that this isn't familiar-- the liminal between night and day between here and there, but there is only a faint carousel of misrememberings and wishes for a different. her one leg crammed into the crux of the other, not becoming lighter 

no don't do   don't stay with this feeling

this ride is loaded. it will never be free. i am only an interim. i am only an idea.
of course, this last line ends with me 


xv:

And i see her there hanging facedown from the faucet dripping her wings whispering bloodspell gone dry, next to her is a flame, next to her is me thinking again 
about the namelessness of existence how few of us seem to talk about it, how it's all one big rusted gymlocker of lies on stilts washing down creekside, to pretend
we know so much 
gotten good at pretending 
progress it's sickness it's coming undone in me this wanting , pretending to know the name for it, this very thing that beats breathless and becomes tired and becomes unworthy under the weight of a name. 
a name creates a rule, denotes an inverse, creates an "other". don't tell me yours, won't hear it
listening to the faucet's drydrip, the sound of her wings like torn redtipped parachutes, exhaling only a hiss of air, but she's bursting forth with life this meeting of ours, and wasn't there a glance? Not learning her this time, i'm witnessing
believing that 
there can still exist a namelessness,
breath between us

  xvi. 

and i see her there, mouth crumbling, hands poised like a doll's, fingertips smudged like a traintrack railtie
</pre>

xvii.

wingwet and sheveled, i see her there, unsuffering in her surrender to the pooling road's slippage,  wings teetering under water's miraculous weight, dipping right and then left, sputtering silent into the 
limp, wading grass, overgrown but useless, like a crop nurtured so long it becomes all grit or hollowed flesh, inedibly so, and this afternoon, every afternoon is her oeuvre, nothing more to strive for beyond this sopping mess in the road --the sounds of water beating wingedness, paper beating rock, the wads of brown, of grass-clotted growth-- not even a road, an alley.
